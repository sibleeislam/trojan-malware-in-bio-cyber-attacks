# Data Collection from Addgene
This is a crawler to download E.coli. plasmid dna sequences from [Addgene site](http://www.addgene.org/). 
Currently (visited on 20 January, 2020) 716 E.coli plasmid data are available on the site. You have to use one script 
to collect the Ids of all E.coli plasmid and then another script to collect all the DNA sequences 
from the site using the Ids.

## Setup
To install required libraries
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You have to have google chrome installed in your machine. Please download the right chrome driver (chromedriver.exe) from 
[here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) according to your installed google chrome version. 
Then update the **collect_ids.py** and **collect_dna_sequence.py** scripts with the 
 correct path of your *chromedriver.exe* as follow.
```
chrome_driver_path = 'C:/Users/siblee/Downloads/chromedriver_win32/chromedriver.exe'
```
## Data Collection
First you have to collect all the Ids of the E.coli plasmid. 
### Collecting E.coli Plasmid Ids
When we search with the term *E.coli* using the search field available on the homepage of the Addgene site, 
we find total 716 plasmid available in there. So, for getting 50 plasmid items per page we need 
to crawl up to 15 pages to get all the plasmid Ids. Please update the values of the variable 
*total_page* and *page_size* (see below) used in **collect_ids.py** script if you find more or less number of 
Ids available whenever you intend to crawl.
```
# configure the followings
chrome_driver_path = 'C:/Users/siblee/Downloads/chromedriver_win32/chromedriver.exe'
total_page = 15
page_size = 50
```
After running the **collect_ids.py** script you will get all ids in a text file called **plasmid_id.txt**.
```
$ python collect_ids.py
```
### Collecting DNA sequences of E.coli Plasmid using Ids
You shall get all the DNA sequences for the Ids available in **plasmid_id.txt** 
by running the **collect_dna_sequences.py** script. Please remember to run it always after running **collect_ids.py**, 
otherwise the required *plasmid_id.txt* file for the srcipt will be missing.
```
$ python collect_dna_sequences.py
```
The script will store all the collected DNA sequences in a text file called **all_plasmid_dna.txt**. 
It is a comma separated file where every line contains the serial number of 
the Ids (chronological order of collected Ids) followed by the plasmid Id, followed by reference of the DNA sequence 
(text mentioned at the start of the DNA sequence) and finally followed by the DNA sequence. In case of some of the 
plasmid Ids you will only find the partial DNA sequences. If the reference is *"> Addgene NGS Result"* 
then it means it is the full DNA sequence of that plasmid.
